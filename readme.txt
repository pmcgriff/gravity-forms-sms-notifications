== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upgrade if I use an old version of this plugin with a Mediaburst username and password? =

If you already have forms set up using your Mediaburst username and password, just upgrade this
plugin from inside your Wordpress admin panel, or delete your existing 'gravity-forms-sms-notifications'
directory and follow the installation instructions above. Your API key will automatically be set
up for you.

= What is a Clockwork API key? = 

To send SMS you will need to sign up for a [Clockwork SMS account][1]
and purchase some SMS credit. When you sign up you'll be given an API key.

= Can I send to multiple mobile numbers? =

Yes, separate each mobile number with a comma.

= What format should the mobile number be in? =

All mobile numbers should be entered in international format without a 
leading + symbol or international dialing prefix.  

For example a UK number should be entered 447123456789, and a Republic 
of Ireland number would be entered 353870123456.
